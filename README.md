PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------------
The Construction Quotation Assistant is designed for the preparation of quotes and planning for the construction of 
concrete retaining walls. It is designed for the input of specifications for individual wall segments which include
the length of the wall segment starting height of the wall segment, the end height of the wall segment. You are able
to add in additional segments as per your requirements. The entire wall (all wall segments) will be displayed from a
top view and then the user can select a wall segment to view it from the front view where you can make manual
adjustments. There is a Options panel which lists the building conditions to allow for surcharge calculations and a 
breakup of each wall segment showing the number of bays, and the number of sleepers and the cost (before surcharges)
of that wall segment. Finally there is a quotation summary which will detail the full cost of the specific quotation
including the cost surcharges due to difficult building requirements.
